# Password Generator

## Description
This webpage allows a user to generate a random password based on the user's selections. It asks for their desired length, and whether or not they would like to includes special characters, numbers, lowercase letters, and uppercase letters. Their new password will then be displayed.

It checks that the length must be an integer, greater than 8 but less than 128, and not empty. The user's character choices (being either true or false) are stored in an array and a string is formed based on these choices. A new password will then be generated by randomly selecting characters in the string.
